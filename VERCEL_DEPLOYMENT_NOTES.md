# Vercel Deployment Notes

## Session Management Improvements
The following changes were made to improve session handling in the Vercel deployed environment:

1. **Session Configuration**:
   - Changed from dynamic secret key to a fixed/environment-variable based key
   - Added Flask-Session support for better session handling
   - Implemented conditional session storage (Redis in production, filesystem in dev)

2. **Authentication Improvements**:
   - Enhanced login and session creation logic
   - Added session health checks and validation
   - Modified profile route to handle session expiration gracefully

3. **URL Navigation Fixes**:
   - Changed profile links from Flask's `url_for()` to direct URLs
   - Added client-side session verification
   - Implemented JavaScript navigation helpers

4. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Updated Vercel.json with proper headers and build commands
   - Added initialization script for required directories
   - Created build script for deployment

## Debugging
- Added `/verify-session` route to help debug session issues
- Enhanced error handling for auth-related errors

## Required Package Changes
Added the following packages to requirements.txt:
- flask-session
- redis (optional for production use)

## Next Steps
1. Setup Redis for production (optional)
2. Monitor session behavior on Vercel
3. Consider implementing more robust auth like JWT if session issues persist
